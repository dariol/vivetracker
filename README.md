# vivetracker
#
# Start adding Vive Tracker support to your Vive game or experience even if you don't have one yet!
# Great for guest who brings their own tracker - includes collider to interact with existing game
#
# Just drop in the prefab into your scene (only appears when actual tracker enters playspace)
#
# - switches on co-op play camera view on desktop (makes it easier to play)
# - optional "pet alert" when initially tracked if a "alert.wav" audio file is placed in your root folder (next to exe)
# - use default or custom model provided
